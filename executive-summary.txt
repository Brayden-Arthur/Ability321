We will be taking a lot of inspiration for the text based RPG from other RPGs and roguelikes. A great example of a good text based game is Zork. It lays out and describes the characters current surroundings with text like 
WEST OF HOUSE
This is an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
There is a small mailbox here.
A rubber mat saying 'Welcome to Zork!' lies by the door.
Zork has commands for movement like go north. This is where we will diverge from the normal idea of movement for text based games.
With access to the google maps api we can have our characters move within the world by moving in the real world. This lets us integrate
more interesting options with the interface without taking away the simplicity of the game. With easier movement we can also have our game act more like a roguelike. Specifically, we will look into implementations that include a procedurally generated level system, character attributes, random items, and random encounters to change the experience every time.

When you die in the game, you die for real. Well not actually for real but you lose all progress in the game unless you get to one of the 
specific save locations. With the seeded nature of the game, it might make it harder or easier to get to the same place as before. This helps
with replayability and allows a character a chance to take a different route to the end-game.

The overall story of the game is still a secret that we won't be sharing. You'll have to play the game to find out!
