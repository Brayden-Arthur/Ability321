		We will be taking a lot of inspiration for the text based RPG from other RPGs and roguelikes. A great example of a good text based game is Zork. It lays out and describes the characters current surroundings with text like <br><br>
		
		<div id="zork">
		<p style="background-color:white;color:black;padding-left:5px;">WEST OF HOUSE</p>
		
		This is an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.<br><br>
		There is a small mailbox here.<br><br>
		A rubber mat saying 'Welcome to Zork!' lies by the door.<br><br><br><br>
		</div>
		
		Zork movement relied on commands such as "move north". We will diverge from this text-based idea of movement.<br><br>
		
		With the Google Maps API we can have our character change zones in the game by moving in the real world. This lets us integrate a more interesting user experience without taking away the simplicity of the game, while adding Role-Playing game features such as a procedurally generated level system, character attributes, random items, and random encounters. <br><br>
		
		When you die in the game you lose all progress in the game - unless you get to a save location. With the seeded nature of the game, it might make it very different to get to the same place as before. Every experience should be unique. <br><br>

		The overall story of the game is still a secret that we won't be sharing. You'll have to play the game to find out!
